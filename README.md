# CATH FunFam Names

This document describes the process of choosing names for the Functional Family (FunFam) clusters in CATH.

## What is a FunFam?

A FunFam is a collection of protein domains (within a Homologous Superfamily in CATH) that we predict to
perform the similar function. These domains can come from one of two sources:

 * **CATH**: sequences from known PDB structures that have been manually chopped into structural domains
 * **Gene3D**: sequences of predicted structural domains

Both of these types of domain (PDB and predicted) can be mapped to a location on a protein sequence in UniProtKB. 

## Distribution of FunFams

The most recent version of CATH contains more than 100,000 FunFam clusters, although many of these clusters only contain a small number of sequences. 
A subset of around 30,000 of these FunFams have a high information content and have been "frozen" ie there is sufficient overall sequence diversity within 
the cluster to provide meaningful information on conserved positions.
